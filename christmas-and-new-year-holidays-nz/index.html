<p>Book your christmas holidays with lastminute.com. Under mondayisation legislation, public holidays that fall on the weekend can be ‘moved’ to the following monday or tuesday. The christmas season, also called the holiday season (often simply called the holidays), or the festive season, is an annually recurring period recognized in many western and other countries that is generally considered to run from november to early january. Please pay attention to the operating hours of testing institutions on holidays. Congratulations to Wanaka, named two of the top South.</p>
