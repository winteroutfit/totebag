<p>Taylor swift grew up on a christmas tree farm that was run by her parents at their pine ridge farm home in reading, pennsylvania. I�ll bet you got your mom another sweater and were your cousins late again when you were putting up the lights this year did you notice one less pair of hands i know this shouldn�t be a lonely time. I love the song, and i love your work on [the remix], mayer said. Light up the street down where the sea and city meet. Taylor Swift London Christmas Light Show 2012. in 2019.</p>
