<p>The rockefeller center christmas tree arrived in new york city on saturday, november 14. A worker helping to get the rockefeller center christmas tree in new york city found the tiny owl among the tree�s massive branches on monday, nov. When the tree was erected in the middle of rockefeller center, one of the workers who helped transport and secure the tree found what looked like a baby owl within its branches. A tiny owl that was found within the boughs after traveling roughly 170 miles from upstate new york is winning hearts as he recovers at a wildlife rescue in the upstate.
