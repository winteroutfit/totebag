<p>I guess I just dont run for that many buses and trains however because I havent found the rolling luggage to be that bad. I use a backpack because of the weight of the bag. I have taken several flights with an 8kg 176 lbs and most others have a 10kg 22 lbs limit. While this makes the bag easier to transport its still heavier and less practical than a backpack on most trips unless youre carrying a lot of bulky equipment.
