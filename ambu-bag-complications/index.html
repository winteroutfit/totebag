Henceforth this attempt of designing an automatic easy-to-operate mechanical device to operatedrive an AMBU bag for ventilation not only will compensate for the dearth of ventilators in low-income and middle-income countries clinical environment but also will provide regulated rate as well as tidal volume thus decreasing the overall complications caused by these manual resuscitators.
