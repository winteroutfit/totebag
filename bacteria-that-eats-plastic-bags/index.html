<p>A Chinese researcher Jun Yang found that plastic bags of millet in his pantry had small holes in them. Plastic bag floats just under the surface - Canary Islands. By screening natural microbial communities exposed to PET in the environment the researchers isolated a novel bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 that is able to use PET as its major energy and carbon source. Polyurethanes are ubiquitous in.</p>

Plastic bags and food packaging etc. 300 billions tons of all plastics manufactured are dumped into the oceans or landfills each year. At this rate it would take these same 100 worms nearly a month to completely break. Despite our best efforts only nine percent of all plastic we use winds up being recycled.</p>

<p>Diatoms the most common type of algae are considered as another potentially viable plastic eater of the future. The best candidates were by far microbes that had been previously exposed to plastic. A few researchers from the University of the Philippines Baguio was able to discover four 4 strains of bacteria which can biodegrade low-density polyethylene or LDPE.

<p>Previous research has also shown that some fungi can break down PET plastic while wax moth larvae usually bred as fish bait can eat up polythene bags. The bacteria found in a region of the North Atlantic Ocean called the Sargasso Sea is clearly breaking down the plastic but scientists dont know if. In fact some of their gut bacteria even seemed to do better eating plastic.

<p>Despite our best efforts only nine percent of all plastic we use winds up being recycled. The mycelium of Pestalotiopsis microspora can eat plastic products as its primary food source and survives without air or light. Over eight million tons of plastic are dumped into the oceans every year. This is perhaps unsurprising since previous reports also suggested bacteria may be evolving to eat plastics by secreting new enzymes 3.
